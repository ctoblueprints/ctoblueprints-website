Though you might think of this type of document as being most useful for current employees, the first thing it will
likely affect is your hiring. Having defined your levels and what they look like, it's suddenly much easier to say,
"oh, we're looking for an E5 Staff Engineer in this next hire".

This template is a google doc. You can make a copy here.

This template is what kicked off the CTO Blueprints project. Toward the end of 2018, Lee, Morgan, and
I were all managing several teams and had started grabbing lunch together to talk through our problems. I needed to
define technical vs management tracks and promotion levels and wasn't finding any time during work hours to do so.
Lee had the same need so he and I started outlining this doc. After one particularly productive lunch at the lovely
St Mark's cafe we had a good structure and had decided on the name CTO Blueprints for the overall project.
That weekend I went to town and knocked out the first version.

A few weeks of comments and improvements ensued from a wider group of engineers and we had a decent doc.
I then forked the first derivative for my work where it immediately started being put to use and evolving in its own
direction. Then we apparently all were busy for a while. Several years later I'm happy to announce the formal launch
of CTO Blueprints and this template for your use.
