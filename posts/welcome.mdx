The first thing we have for you is templates for common documents that engineering organizations need.
Onboarding docs, tracks and levels docs, manager guides, etc.
They are all Creative Commons by Attribution licensed unless otherwise noted, making them easy to use in your organization.
You should make a copy of what you need, slap on your company logo, and start changing it to suit your needs.
The goal is to help engineering organizations more quickly become highly effective and be great places to work.

The licensing info is already at the bottom of the doc.
Just leave it in and add some info about the great improvements you are making to your doc.
Speaking of which, contributions are welcome. If the base doc is in github, create a PR.
If it's in google docs, contact us and we'll figure out with you the best way to get the changes in.
